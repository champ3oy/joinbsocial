          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>BINDING ARBITRATION </strong>
          <br />
          In the event that either party asserts that there is a dispute arising
          out of or relating to this Agreement, such party shall first notify
          the other party in writing, specifying the nature of the dispute and
          scheduling a meeting to attempt to resolve the dispute.
          <br />
          <br />
          If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) calendar days of the
          delivery of the written notice, either party may then elect to
          exclusively and finally resolve the dispute by binding arbitration by
          filing a written notice of arbitration in accordance with this section
          under the subheading “Binding Arbitration” and the Rules of
          Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
          applicable at the time of submission of the dispute to arbitration
          (the “ICC Rules”).
          <br />
          <br />
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ICC Rules, the
          following terms and conditions shall apply.
          <br />
          <br />
          The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3)
          arbitrators. Each party shall have the right to appoint one (1)
          arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the delivery of the
          written notice of arbitration, and a third arbitrator shall be
          selected by those two (2) party-appointed arbitrators within thirty
          (30) days of the appointment of the two (2) party-appointed
          arbitrators.
          <br />
          <br />
          The arbitration proceedings shall be held in San Francisco,
          California, United States of America in the English language.
          <br />
          <br />
          The parties shall equally bear the costs and fees of the arbitration,
          and each party shall bear its own cost for its own legal expenses. The
          arbitrators shall apply the substantive law set forth in the section
          of this Agreement under the subheading “Governing Law”. Any
          arbitration proceeding shall be conducted on a confidential basis. The
          arbitrators shall specify the reason and basis for their decision, the
          reason for any damages awarded and the breakdown for such damages
          awarded, and the basis for any other remedy authorized under this
          Agreement, including but not limited to injunctive relief or specific
          performance. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
          shall prevent us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.
          <br />
          <br />
          The decision of the arbitrators shall be considered as a final and
          binding resolution of the dispute, shall be final and binding on the
          parties, and shall not be subject to appeal or reexamination. The
          award of the arbitrators may be entered as a judgment and enforced by
          any court of competent jurisdiction.
          <br />
          <br />
